Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error with rewards/penalties

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Decision Trees: Tree-like model for decisions
- Neural Networks: Inspired by the human brain
- Support Vector Machines: For classification tasks

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
