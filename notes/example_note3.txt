Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Core Tasks:
- Tokenization: Breaking text into words or subwords
- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying grammatical roles
- Named Entity Recognition: Finding names, places, organizations
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotional tone
- Machine Translation: Translating between languages

Modern Approaches:
- Word Embeddings: Representing words as vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Transformers: Architecture that revolutionized NLP (BERT, GPT)
- Attention Mechanisms: Allowing models to focus on relevant parts

Applications:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Text summarization
- Language translation
- Content generation
- Question answering systems

Key Challenges:
- Ambiguity in language
- Context understanding
- Handling multiple languages
- Bias in training data
