Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives the input data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data (can have multiple layers)
- Output Layer: Produces the final result

Deep Learning:
Deep learning uses neural networks with many hidden layers (hence "deep"). This allows the network to learn complex patterns and representations.

Key Components:
- Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks
- Gradient Descent: Optimization method to minimize error

Popular Architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For sequential data
- Transformers: For natural language processing

Training Process:
1. Forward pass: Data flows through the network
2. Calculate loss: Compare output with expected result
3. Backward pass: Update weights using gradients
4. Repeat until convergence
